# Contributing to `safecheck`

Thanks for contributing! Before implementing features and changes, please submit an issue to discuss the proposed changes.

## How to submit a pull request

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/davnn/safecheck/fork).
2. Clone the forked repository and add a new branch with the feature name.

Before submitting your code as a pull request please do the following steps:

1. Add any changes you want
2. Add tests for the new changes
3. Edit documentation if you have changed something significant
4. Run `task format` to format your changes.
5. Run `task lint` to ensure code style checks.
6. Run `task typing` to ensure type checks.
7. Run `task safety` to ensure safety checks.
8. Run `task test` to verify that all tests are passing.

Conveniently, you can run `task check`, to combine all the mentioned commands. We use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) to categorize different kinds of commits.

## Contributing without `task`

We use [task](https://taskfile.dev/) to provide pre-configured CLI commands for the project, but `task` is not required, you can also run the commands directly from the CLI.
Have a look at `Taskfile.yml` for a reference of commands.

## Install dependencies

We use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage the dependencies. Run
`task pre-commit-install` to add the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks.
