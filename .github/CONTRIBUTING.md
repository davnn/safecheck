# Contributing to `safecheck`

Thanks for contributing! Before implementing features and changes, please submit an issue to discuss  the proposed
changes.

## How to submit a pull request

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/davnn/safecheck/fork).
2. Clone the forked repository and add a new branch with the feature name.

Before submitting your code as a pull request please do the following steps:

1. Add any changes you want
2. Add tests for the new changes
3. Edit documentation if you have changed something significant
4. Run `task format` to format your changes.
5. Run `task lint` to ensure code style checks.
6. Run `task typing` to ensure type checks.
7. Run `task safety` to ensure safety checks.
8. Run `task test` to verify that all tests are passing.

Conveniently, you can run `task check`, to combine all the mentioned commands. We use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/)
to categorize different kinds of commits.

## Contributing without `task`

We use [task](https://taskfile.dev/) to provide pre-configured CLI commands for the project, but `task` is
not required, you can also run the commands directly from the CLI. Have a look at `Taskfile.yml` for a reference of
commands.

## Set up a poetry environment

We use [micromamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) to set up a Python environment
for [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Make sure that ``micromamba`` is installed and available. Run
`task env-create` to create an empty Python 3.10 environment named `safecheck`. After you have successfully created the
conda environment  activate it with `micromamba activate safecheck`. If `poetry` is not already installed, run
`task poetry-install`. Using the  activated `safecheck` environment check if poetry is using the right environment with
`poetry env info`. Once the poetry setup is complete, you are ready to install the dependencies.

Note that Conda is not necessary, you can use a tool of your choice to manage your Python environment. One benefit of
using Conda is that we can override packages that are not easy to install with `pip`.

## Install dependencies

We use [`poetry`](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to manage the dependencies. With an active poetry env,
run `task install` to install all dependencies into environment. After the dependencies are installed, run
`task pre-commit-install` to add the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks.

You can contribute by spreading a word about this library. It would also be a huge contribution to write a short article
on how you are using this project. You can also share your best practices with us.
